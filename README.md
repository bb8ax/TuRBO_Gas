# Trust Region Bayesian Optimized Network of Artificial Olfactory Receptors for Spatiotemporal Monitoring of NO2 gas 

This is a supplementary codes for the paper: Trust Region Bayesian Optimized Network of Artificial Olfactory Receptors for Spatiotemporal Monitoring of NO2 gas .

The code includes tflite based file generation, dataset, test and validation processes.

Before starting, the code requires jupyter lab for operation.

# Basic Jupyter Notebook Setup and Run Guide

## Prerequisites

Before we start, make sure you have the following installed on your system:
- Python 3.12
- pip (Python package installer)

## Installation

1. **Install Jupyter Notebook via pip**

   Open your terminal (for MacOS/Linux) or command prompt/PowerShell (for Windows) and run the following command:

2. **Verify Installation**

To ensure Jupyter Notebook was installed correctly, run the following command:
This should display the version of Jupyter Notebook installed.

## Running Jupyter Notebook

1. **Start Jupyter Notebook**

In your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you wish to create your notebooks or where your notebooks are located, then run:
This command will start the Jupyter Notebook server and open your default web browser to the Jupyter interface.

2. **Create a New Notebook**

- In the Jupyter Notebook interface, you'll see a "New" button at the top right. Click it and select "Python 3" to create a new notebook.

3. **Using Jupyter Notebook**

- You can now start writing Python code in cells and run them interactively. To run a cell, press `Shift + Enter`.
- You can add new cells, delete cells, and change the cell type (code or markdown for text) using the toolbar.

4. **Save and Exit**

- To save your notebook, click the floppy disk icon in the toolbar.
- To exit, close the browser tab and stop the Jupyter server in your terminal by pressing `Ctrl + C`.

## Additional Resources

For more detailed instructions and advanced usage, visit the [Jupyter Project documentation](https://jupyter.org/documentation).

## Run the code

1. **Run 'BO_Gas_sensor_T9_EI-TurBO_10.ipynb' file to execute Bayesian optimization and generate optimized neural network.

The code describes how 10 sensors were positioned to optimized region for better detection.

2. **Run 'SPresense_TF_GAS.ino' file

- The code leaves microprocessor (Sony SPresense) to listening mode.
- Refer to https://github.com/sonydevworld/tflite-micro-spresense-examples and https://blog.tensorflow.org/2021/10/TF-Lite-Sony-Spresense.html for the detailed settings.

3. **Run 'BO_Gas_sensor_T9_Neural_Network_verify_Board.ipynb' file

The code trains and validates the neural network based on the position generated by the Bayesian Optimization.
