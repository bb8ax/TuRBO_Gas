# Stereoscopic Artificial Compound Eyes for Spatiotemporal Perception in 3D space via Edge Computing

This is a supplementary material for the paper: Stereoscopic Artificial Compound Eyes for Spatiotemporal Perception in 3D space via Edge Computing.

The code includes tflite based file generation, dataset, test and validation processes.

Before starting, the code requires jupyter lab for operation.

# Basic Jupyter Notebook Setup and Run Guide

## Prerequisites

Before we start, make sure you have the following installed on your system:
- Python 3.12
- pip (Python package installer)

## Installation

1. **Install Jupyter Notebook via pip**

   Open your terminal (for MacOS/Linux) or command prompt/PowerShell (for Windows) and run the following command:

2. **Verify Installation**

To ensure Jupyter Notebook was installed correctly, run the following command:
This should display the version of Jupyter Notebook installed.

## Running Jupyter Notebook

1. **Start Jupyter Notebook**

In your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you wish to create your notebooks or where your notebooks are located, then run:
This command will start the Jupyter Notebook server and open your default web browser to the Jupyter interface.

2. **Create a New Notebook**

- In the Jupyter Notebook interface, you'll see a "New" button at the top right. Click it and select "Python 3" to create a new notebook.

3. **Using Jupyter Notebook**

- You can now start writing Python code in cells and run them interactively. To run a cell, press `Shift + Enter`.
- You can add new cells, delete cells, and change the cell type (code or markdown for text) using the toolbar.

4. **Save and Exit**

- To save your notebook, click the floppy disk icon in the toolbar.
- To exit, close the browser tab and stop the Jupyter server in your terminal by pressing `Ctrl + C`.
